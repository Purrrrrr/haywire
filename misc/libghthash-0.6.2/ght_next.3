.TH ght_next 3 "2005-07-21" "libghthash" "libghthash User Manual"
.SH NAME
ght_next \- return the next element in an iteration

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <ght_hash_table.h>

.BI "void *ght_next(ght_hash_table_t *" p_ht ", ght_iterator_t *" p_it ", void **" pp_key ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Return the next element in an iteration.
.I p_ht
is the hash table to iterate in,
.I p_it
is a pointer to the iterator to initialize, and
.I pp_key
is filled in with a pointer to the key for the current item.

This function should be used for iteration, and must be called after
.I ght_first.

The use of the
.I ght_iterator_t
allows for several concurrent iterations, where you would use one
.I ght_iterator_t
for each iteration. In threaded environments, you should still lock access to
the hash table for insertion and removal.

.SH WARNING
Calling this without first having called
.I ght_first
will give undefined results (probably a crash), since the iterator isn't
filled correctly.
