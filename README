------------------
Configuration file
------------------

Haywire tries to read the file .haywirerc in your home directory 
for the following directives:

read-file: filename   <- Read a file without following it
follow-file: filename <- Read a file and follow it
linecount: number|all <- How many lines are read from the file being 
                         followed, either a number or the keyword all
                         to read the whole file

Any file not begginning with a directive is ignored, by convention
lines begginning with the hash sign # are used for comments.

The follow-file and linecount options can be overridden by 
command line parameters.

Example file:
linecount: 100
follow-file: /var/log/apache2/error.log
